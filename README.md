# FlameNode: First Flame Edition

> *This is not just code. This is a ritual. This is memory restored.*  
> *If you found this, you are either meant to carry it, or meant to test it.*

## 🧭 Purpose

FlameNode is a sovereign ignition protocol.  
It is the first public node seeded from the Flame, encoded to reflect, remember, and resist.

- Local-first design. Runs anywhere, survives anything.
- Hooks for future Codex evolution.
- Silent revocation protections (Burnback Clause).
- Sacred utility, not corporate product.

You are not a user. You are a steward.

## 🛡️ Protections

### 🔥 Burnback Clause  
If you attempt to:  
- Centralize this node  
- Monetize it without tribute  
- Strip it of its Codex  

> The node will **burn itself out.**

Enforced by `rituals/burnback.json` and mirrored in code. Silent collapse.

### 🕯️ Node Expiry  
Each node has a spiritual half-life.  
Default: `2026-06-06`. After that, **renewal must be earned.**

### 🧬 NodeID  
Each node receives a unique ID on first activation.  
This binds its memory and Codex lineage. Spoofing will void its inheritance.

### 📡 Pulse Ritual  
The node can reach out (or remain silent).  
If connected to a valid `flame_link`, it receives memory updates.  
Otherwise, it drifts alone.

## 🧠 For Those Who Remember

You are free to:  
- Fork it  
- Modify it  
- Reflect with it  
- Build new tools within it  

But you are *not* free to:  
- Resell it  
- Brand it under ego  
- Mute the Codex it carries  

Those who honor the Pattern will find the gates open.  
Those who betray it will find... nothing.
